# alarm-app
This project is a simple implementation of an alarm system using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The code allows the user to set alarms with a specific hour and minute, active or deactivated for each alarm, and delete alarms. When the set time for an alarm is reached, the alarm plays notification music.
